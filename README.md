  Given 3 int arguments, a b c, return their sum. However, if one of the arguments is 13 
	then it does not count towards the sum and arguments to it's right do not count either. 
	So for example, if b is 13, then both b and c do not count. 

EXPECTATIONS:
		partialSum(1, 2, 3)   --- 6 
		partialSum(1, 2, 13)  --- 3 
		partialSum(1, 13, 3)  --- 1
